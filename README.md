# CVE Report Generator
## Introduction
Cvereportgenerator is a python script that is used to generate CVE report after parsing ,cleaning and removing null values from the desired file.
## Requirements
Having python installed .
## installation 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Combinaison
We combine many notions like cvss ,epss,cisa,agevulnerability and sla to obtain a file which is going to be used as a final file for our report generation
## How it works
a simplified schema was designed to explain how the script works

everyone needs to have his personal file,
the cisa file, the cveriskfile and the filetomerge file.
## Usage
To generate the file which you are going to use for your vulnerability report you need to 
```python
python filegenrator.py
```
To generate PDF report you need to 
```python
python pdfreport.py
```

## Needed Files
* cverisk :A file which contains most common severities
* cisa : A file which contains all vulnerabilities
* filetmerge: A file which contains most common epss and cvss
* myfile :The file that you want to transform to an adequate file for the process of generating reports
